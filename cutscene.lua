    -- Here is where you start up things that need to start happening, such as timers,
    -- tranistions, physics, music playing, etc. 
    -- In this case, resume physics by calling physics.start()
    -- Fade out the levelText (i.e start a transition)
    -- Start up the enemy spawning engine after the levelText fades

        -- place to "reset" things that might be reset, i.e. move an object back to its starting
        -- position. Since the scene isn't on screen yet, your users won't see things "jump" to new
        -- locations. In this case, reset the score to 0.

--
-- When you call composer.removeScene() from another module, composer will go through and
-- remove anything created with display.* and inserted into the scene's view group for you. In
-- many cases that's sufficent to remove your scene. 
--
-- But there may be somethings you loaded, like audio in scene:create() that won't be disposed for
-- you. This is where you dispose of those things.
-- In most cases there won't be much to do here.
